                                    It was an incredible experience! I learnt to deal with multiculturalism and I discovered the Finnish people.</br>
                                    I learnt the basics of the Finnish language thanks to a course called <em>Finnish 1A</em>. In addition, I participated to the campus social life, especially through <em>Language Cafes</em>, which are opportunities to meet new people as well as improving our language skills in a foreing language. <em>Language Cafes</em> are language classes taught by students to their peers.</br>
                                    During this semester at <a href="https://www.uef.fi/en" target="_blank">UEF</a>, I took classes related to <strong>Data Science</strong>, such as <strong>Bayesian Inference</strong> or <strong>Learning Analytics</strong>, but also <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, without forgetting <strong>Web Programming</strong>.</br>
                                    This experience really developed my soft skills and organisation.</br>

                                    During this first year at 
                                    <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/#:~:text=200%20ans%20d'excellence.%20%C3%89cole%20d'ing%C3%A9nieurs" target="_blank">
                                    EMSE</a> I developed my <strong>general engineering skills</strong> by strengthing and expanding my 
                                    knowledge related to various themes in <strong>mathematics</strong>, <strong>physics</strong>, <strong>environment</strong> 
                                    and <strong>IT</strong>.
                                    I participated to a <em>Citizen Project ("Projet Citoyen")</em> within a team of 8 persons. 
                                    This project was realised in partnership with the <a href="https://auvergne-rhone-alpes.lpo.fr/" target="_blank">
                                    "Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux" (LPO)</a> and aimed at developing audio walks in the Parc de Montaud in 
                                    Saint-Etienne. This project made me want to learn more about project methodologies, working in teams and leadership, 
                                    which was possible thanks to the elective course at 
                                    <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/#:~:text=200%20ans%20d'excellence.%20%C3%89cole%20d'ing%C3%A9nieurs" target="_blank">
                                    EMSE</a> called <strong>Project Management</strong>.<br/>
                                    I also discovered my interest for IT, and I followed an elective course in <strong>Calculation High Performances 
                                    ("Calcul Hautes Performances")</strong> and learnt the basics of multi-threading and GPU programmation.</br>
                                    <br/>
                                    <strong><em>Second Year:</em></strong><br/>
                                    Half of my second year was spent abroad, in Finland, were I learnt <strong>Data Science</strong> and 
                                    <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>.<br/>
                                    During the second semester, I was back in Saint-Etienne, and I followed a major elective course in <strong>Big Data</strong> : 
                                    <em>data bases</em> (<em>SQL</em>, <em>MongoD</em>, <em>Cassandra</em>), <em>hashing methods</em>, <em>data structures</em>... 
                                    I also followed a minor elective course in <strong>Integrated Applications</strong> i.e. mastering <em>spreadsheets</em> like 
                                    <em>Excel</em> and <em>macros</em>, and another one in <strong>Networks</strong> (learning the basics of the Internet and 
                                    networkd and constructing a private network).<br/>
                                    This semester, I also applied my knowledge learnt in Finland by developing a <em>web application</em> for a project named 
                                    <em>PRICE ("Projet d'innovation de cr&eacute;ation et d'entrepreneuriat")</em>. For this project, I realised with 3 other students 
                                    a first version of the application (we developed the design and some functionnalities) and tested it with beta testers. We made 
                                    <em>polls</em>, a <em>market research</em> and a <em>business plan</em><br>
                                    In addition, I had the opportunity to develop during one week a <strong>bot</strong> in Python for an online strategy game.<br>

                                    <br/>
                                    <strong><em>Third Year:</em></strong><br/>
                                    I prepare a Master degree in <strong>Image Processing</strong> as well as my Engineer degree.<br/>
                                    For my Engineer degree, I have chosen a major in <strong>Information Technology</strong>, in which I learn 
                                    <strong>Technological Foundations of Software Development</strong> <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, 
                                    <strong>Interoperability and Semantics</strong>, <strong>Security, Trust and Privacy</strong>.

                                    My task was to develop a static web site for documenting an software for modular applications developed by

                                    An amazing experience that permited me to be part of the <strong>Olympic Games</strong> event!</br>
                                    This work experience allowed me to put into practice skills and knowledge learnt during my three years of higher education. I had two main tasks: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Test & Tagging.</strong> This task consisted in analysing the electronic devices emitting or receiving frequences and tag them according to their conformity or not with the frequences declared by the stakeholder. We used <em>tiny spectrum analyzers</em> or less frequently <em>frequency meters</em>. We worked in binomes during this first part which consisted for me in three weeks at Saint-Etienne's venue (Geoffroy Guichard stadium). Two roles had been identified: <strong>Technical Agent</strong> (analysing devices) or <strong>Administrative Agent</strong> (welcoming the users and entering data in the online platform). With my binome, we alternatively did both.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Monitoring.</strong> The aim was to check the frequencies in real time to make sure that there was no scrambling, for example in communications. I worked in teams with other students and foreign agents, in Paris (Yves-du-Manoir stadium), during one week.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    A one-month training experience that made me discover the <strong>industrial world</strong>. By experiencing the daily life of an operator, I had an insight of operator's working conditions, factory functionning, hierarchy, and so on. I could also assist to meetings and discover other sectors than Production, like Security and Environment or Human Resources for example.</br>
